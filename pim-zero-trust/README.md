# Privileged Identity Management (PIM)

## Overview
Deployed Microsoft Entra PIM to convert permanent admin roles into Just-In-Time (JIT) eligible assignments. Enforced MFA and approval workflows, minimizing insider threats and enhancing auditability.

## Problem
IT staff had permanent global admin and security admin rights, violating the principle of least privilege and increasing risk of insider misuse or external compromise.

## Solution
- Converted permanent role assignments into eligible assignments.  
- Required MFA and approval workflows for role elevation.  
- Set time limits on admin sessions with automatic expiration.  
- Enabled full auditing of role activations.

## Results
- Eliminated standing privileges for admins.  
- All admin activities became auditable.  
- Insider and external attack surfaces were minimized.
