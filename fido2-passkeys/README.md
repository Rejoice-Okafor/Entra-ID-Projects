# FIDO2 Passkeys â€“ Passwordless Authentication

## Overview
Implemented passwordless authentication using FIDO2 security keys and biometric passkeys in Entra ID. Eliminated password-based logins, reducing phishing risks and improving user experience.

## Problem
Users relied on passwords, which were vulnerable to phishing and brute-force attacks. Helpdesk calls for password resets were frequent.

## Solution
- Registered FIDO2 security keys and passkeys (Windows Hello, biometrics) in Entra ID.  
- Configured authentication methods policy to enable passwordless sign-ins.  
- Tested sign-in with Microsoft 365 and other Entra-integrated apps using face recognition/biometric authentication.

## Results
- Password-based logins eliminated for targeted user groups.  
- Phishing and credential theft risks reduced near-zero.  
- Improved user experience with faster, secure login flows.
